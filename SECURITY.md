# Responsible Disclosure Policy

## Overview

At [SYMOH](https://s3c6.netlify.app) Tech, led by [SYMOH](https://s3c6.netlify.app), we prioritize the security of our projects and the safety of our users. Responsible disclosure is a collaborative process where security researchers or individuals who discover vulnerabilities in this project report them privately to us, allowing time to address the issue before public disclosure. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are fixed promptly, protecting users from potential exploitation. We value the security community’s efforts and thank you for helping keep this project secure!

## What is Responsible Disclosure?

Responsible disclosure (also known as coordinated vulnerability disclosure) involves privately reporting security vulnerabilities to the project maintainer, [SYMOH](https://s3c6.netlify.app), so we can investigate and resolve them before they are publicly shared. This prevents malicious actors from exploiting issues and ensures a safer experience for all users.

## Key Principles

1. **Private Reporting**: If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately via the button below or through a private issue on this repository (if enabled). Avoid sharing details publicly (e.g., on X, public issues, or forums) until we’ve resolved the issue.

2. **Detailed Submission**: Provide a comprehensive report, including:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability.
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact (e.g., data breach, unauthorized access).
   - Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots (shared securely).
3. **Reasonable Timeframe**: We commit to acknowledging your report within 48 hours and aim to resolve the issue within 30–90 days, depending on its severity and complexity. We’ll keep you updated on our progress.
4. **Collaboration**: Work with us to validate and fix the vulnerability. Please refrain from exploiting the issue beyond what’s necessary to demonstrate it or sharing it with others until resolved.
5. **Controlled Disclosure**: After the issue is fixed, we’ll coordinate with you on public disclosure, if appropriate. We’re happy to credit you as “Discovered by [Your Name]” in our release notes or a Security Hall of Fame (if you choose).

## Why Responsible Disclosure Matters

- **User Protection**: Private reporting prevents attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities before they’re patched, safeguarding our users.
- **Trust and Collaboration**: By handling reports professionally, we build trust with the security community and encourage collaborative efforts to improve our project.
- **Enhanced Security**: Your contributions help [SYMOH](https://s3c6.netlify.app) Tech deliver more secure and reliable solutions.
- **Ethical Standards**: Responsible disclosure aligns with ethical and legal best practices, ensuring vulnerabilities are handled responsibly.
